1- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A file called .git would be created when you initialize a respository using
	git init. This file will not create a commit or add the files in the directory
	to the repository. If we did not do it, a repository would not be created and
	no commits would be saved and version control would not be implemented.

2- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
   What value do you think it offers?
   
   The staging area contains the files that will be saved if a commit was commanded.
   The working directory contains all files, even files that are not being tracked
   by the repository. This allows for smaller sizes of the repository since it will
   only include the files that I think are related to the project. No need to keep
   track of a file that is complete and will not be changed for the rest of the 
   development. The repository contains the saved versions that we commited.
